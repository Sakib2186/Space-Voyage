## :muscle: What I Learned

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Game development using Unity, writing gameplay logic in C#, scene management (Menu, Level 1, Level 2), collision detection and physics, audio effects and particle systems, level design and player controls
Overall, it was a fun learning experience that strengthened my understanding of both C# programming and Unity’s game development workflow.
